After crushing, maceration, managed with soft pumping over and delèstage, was continued for 15 days in stainless steel tanks. During this phase, the wines completed the alcoholic fermentation at a temperature not exceeding 26 ° C. After the vinification of the wine, the malolactic fermentation took place directly in French and Hungarian oak barrels, in which it was raised for about 10 months. A further period of 8 months of aging in bottle followed before being placed on the market. Characterized by an intense ruby ​​red color. It has fruity aromas of plum, blackberry and raspberry combined with the spicy ones of pepper, coffee and cocoa. On the palate it releases a soft, rich, pleasant and elegant flavor, of good intensity and persistence. Serve at a temperature of 18-20 ° C.",
